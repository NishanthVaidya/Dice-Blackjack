Dice-Blackjack is an engaging two-player dice game that puts a unique spin on traditional blackjack. Players compete by rolling between 2 to 4 dice, aiming to get as close to 16 as possible without going over.
Before each round, players place their bets using an intuitive slider system, adding a strategic gambling element to the game.
The game features a responsive design that seamlessly adapts between portrait and landscape orientations, complete with smooth dice rolling animations that bring the gameplay to life. Players can personalize their experience by entering custom names, and new players can quickly learn the game through an accessible rules modal. 
Going over 16 results in an immediate loss, making each roll a tense decision of whether to play it safe or risk it all for a better score. 
The game also includes an about section with developer information, rounding out a polished and feature-complete gaming experience.
